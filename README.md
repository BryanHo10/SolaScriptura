# SolaScriptura

SolaScriptura serves as a tool to help people memorize verses/passages from God's word. God has given us his word to help us see and know the truth of His divine nature and our depraved state in sin. Thanks to the Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, who steers hearts from sin towards righteousness. Therefore, we must be diligent to keep his words in our hearts.

> All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.
>
> 2 Timothy 3:16-17 (ESV)
